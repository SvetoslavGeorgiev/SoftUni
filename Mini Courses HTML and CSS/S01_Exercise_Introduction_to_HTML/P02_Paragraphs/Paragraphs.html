    <h1>Principles For Clean HTML Code</h1>
    <p><strong>Beautiful and clean HTML</strong> is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about <strong>CSS</strong>, I always begin by telling them that good <strong>CSS</strong> can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of <strong>clean, semantic HTML</strong> are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.</p>
    <p><strong>Strict DOCTYPE</strong>. If we are going to do this, let’s just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use <em>HTML 4.01</em> or <em>XHTML 1.0</em> both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as we write our code.</p>
    <p><strong>Character set & encoding characters</strong>. In our &lthead> section, the very first thing should be the <strong>declaration</strong> of our character set. We’re using <strong>UTF-8</strong> here, which is swell, but it’s listed after our &lttitle>. Let’s go ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set it’s dealing with before it starts reading any content at all.</p>
    <p>The next time you write <strong>HTML</strong>, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you can to make it <strong>right</strong>.</p>
    <p><em>The interwebs will love you!</em></p>
